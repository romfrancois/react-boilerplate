# react-boilerplate

For years now I've had the habit when creating a new repo to just copy/paste bits from different repos before even starting the project.

I then realised that I was kinda creating a boilerplate project every single time!

So rather than doing that I thought it would be more practical to just clone a repo and adapt it to a new project.

Here it is.

This will assume the project will be react based, relying on eslint/prettier for formatting and assuring style consistency.

Coding will be done in TypeScript.

Having enjoyed lately trying out GitHub Actions & Netlify I'll add some snippets for both to be included as well.

Let me know if you stopped by and noticed something I haven't thought about.

# README

## Basics
Insert the description of what the project is about.

<br>
<br>

## Netlify 
If required, add a Netlify badge here; you can grab it from the Netlify UI.

```
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d7b2b5d5-c8a6-42c2-bd02-c52e828af2f0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/romfrancois-movie-app/deploys)
```

To deploy to Netlify please follow the steps:
<br>
// TODO <br>
// TODO GH Actions <br>
// TODO Netlify config <br>

<br>
<br>

## package.json
If not explicit enough in the _package.json_ file describe all the steps to install, run & test your application

<br>
<br>

## Screenshot
If not alreday deployed and/or if the user doesn't want to open it up, you could add the main screenshot of your app.

## Stat Badges
If it applies, you can add stat badges too:
